Description


Dongle(동글) is a rounded san-serif typeface for display and the name means ‘rounded shape(with cute impression)’ in Korean. 

Dongle was originally designed as a 'Jamo(consonant and vowel in Hangeul) typing module' for the author's student project. Later it revised into ‘one syllable module’ to be released to the public.

As the character size varies according to the syllable construction, it is much smaller than other Korean typefaces in the text. Therefore, it is better to adjust the font size visually, not based on the point size of the editing program.

It consists of a full set of modern Hangeul syllables(11,172 characters), Google Latin core set and some of the symbols in KS X 1001. This typeface has light, medium and bold weight.
